# Creating chunked datasets

+++

In this chapter we'll step through practical examples showing to create chunked datasets.
To start we'll look at how to create individual Zarr datasets and save them, where each Zarr dataset represents a single 3D image.
Then we'll look at how to create an OME-Zarr multiscale image, to to save it, and how to add downsampled images that live alongside the original full resolution image.

Note: this chapter (and the whole of the textbook) uses Zarr version 2 and OME-Zarr version 0.4. Although newer versions exist (Zarr version 3 and OME-Zarr version 0.5), software tools have not quite caught up to support the newer versions.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from rich import print

from data_helpers import load_heart_data, plot_slice
```

## Creating Zarr datasets

To being this chapter, we'll look at how to create Zarr datasets. As a recap from chapter 1, Zarr is a specification for storing individual arrays, and groups of those arrays, in some sort of storage medium.

To start with we'll load our heart sample dataset again, as a NumPy array.

```{code-cell} ipython3
heart_image = load_heart_data(array_type='numpy')
plot_slice(heart_image, z_idx=70)
```

While it is possible to easily save this data to the Zarr format using the zarr-python package in one line, we're going to take a slightly different and more manual approach. Our approach will avoid hiding the configuration of the Zarr data.
This way we'll see what options are available to use when creating a Zarr array, and the process mirrors the one we'll use later in this chapter to create an OME-Zarr dataset.

Using a library called pydantic-zarr, we can create an _array specification_.
This is a model of how we want to configure the Zarr array.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from pydantic_zarr.v2 import ArraySpec
from numcodecs import Zstd

array_spec = ArraySpec(
    shape=heart_image.shape,
    dtype=heart_image.dtype,
    chunks=(32, 32, 32),
    compressor=Zstd(level=5),
)
print(array_spec)
```

We've specified four different parameters:

- `shape`: The shape of array we want to store.
- `dtype`: The data type of the array we want to store.
- `chunks`: The chunk shape of the Zarr array
- `compressor`: The compression algorithm (and any configuration for it) that we want to compress the data with.

And some parameters have been filled in automatically for us with default values:

- `zarr_version`: the version of Zarr used to save the array
- `attributes`: any custom metadata
- `fill_value`: the value assumed if no data has been written
- `order`: the memory order
- `filters`: any filters applied to the data before being saved
- `dimension_separator`: the character separating chunks in different dimensions when the data is saved

Now we've specified the array configuration, we can convert this to an actual Zarr array.
To do this we need to create a _store_.
This represents where the Zarr array is stored - examples include in memory, on a local disk, or in some remote cloud storage.
For a list of available stores see the [`zarr.storage` documentation](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/v2.18.5/api/storage.html).

Here we'll use a in memory store.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import zarr

store = zarr.MemoryStore()
zarr_array = array_spec.to_zarr(store=store, path="/")
zarr_array
```

The zarr array we've created acts in the same way as a normal NumPy array, so we can pass it to functions that work on NumPy arrays like our `plot_slice` function:

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_slice(zarr_array, z_idx=70)
```

This doesn't look right! That's because we never add any data to our Zarr array, so it's assumed that all the data takes the fill value, which is

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(zarr_array.fill_value)
```

To add data to the array, we can just assign it using the usual NumPy syntax. The `[:]` here means "all the data in this array":

```{code-cell} ipython3
zarr_array[:] = heart_image[:]
plot_slice(zarr_array, z_idx=70)
```

To recap, there were three steps to creating an array:

1. Specify the array metadata
2. Use that metadata to create an empty Zarr array in a specific store
3. Fill the new array with data

To change where the array is stored, we can change the store used, for example to save to a local directory on your computer:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from pathlib import Path
import tempfile

from data_helpers import get_directory_contents

temp_dir = tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()
temp_path = Path(temp_dir.name)
print(f"Created temporary directory at {temp_path}")
print(f"Directory contents before saving: {get_directory_contents(temp_path)}")

store = zarr.DirectoryStore(temp_dir.name)
zarr_array = array_spec.to_zarr(store=store, path="/")
print(f"Directory contents after creating array: {get_directory_contents(temp_path)}")

zarr_array[:] = heart_image[:]
print(f"Directory contents after adding data: {get_directory_contents(temp_path)}")
zarr_array

temp_dir.cleanup()
```

After saving the (empty) array, two files are created - '.zarray' and '.zattrs'.
These store the Zarr array metdadata.
After adding data to the array, four more folders appear - '0', '1', '2', '3'.
These folders store the array data.

## Creating OME-Zarr datasets

[OME-Zarr](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/specifications/index.html) is a specification for storing bio-imaging data.
OME-Zarr data consists of two components:

1. Data stored in Zarr format
2. Metadata used to interpret the data

The OME-Zarr metadata is additional metadata that lives in the `attributes` property of Zarr arrays and groups.
The OME-Zarr specification contains details for storing a number of different types of data.
For storing 3D imaging data we will use the multiscale specification.

## Writing OME-Zarr datasets

There are a number of different Python libraries available for writing OME-Zarr multiscale datasets.
A list of them at time of writing, along with their pros and cons is available in the [appendices](appendices.md).
For this textbook we'll be using [ome-zarr-models](https://ome-zarr-models-py.readthedocs.io), which is a Python package for creating and validating OME-Zarr datasets.

Lets start by loading some data to convert to OME-Zarr.

+++

At this point we just have a single 3D image array, stored as a numpy array in the memory of our computer.

To save it as an OME-Zarr Image dataset, we will use the `ome-zarr-models` library.
The first step is to create a new OME-Zarr Image:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from ome_zarr_models.v04 import Image
from ome_zarr_models.v04.axes import Axis

voxel_size = 19.89
ome_zarr_image = Image.new(
    array_specs = [ArraySpec.from_array(zarr_array)],
    paths = ["level0"],
    axes = [
        Axis(name="x", type="space", unit="um"),
        Axis(name="y", type="space", unit="um"),
        Axis(name="z", type="space", unit="um")
    ],
    global_scale = [voxel_size, voxel_size, voxel_size],
    scales = [[1, 1, 1]],
    translations = [[0, 0, 0]],
    name = "heart_image"
)
print(ome_zarr_image)
```

As before, we can write this (empty) zarr group to a store:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ome_store = zarr.MemoryStore()
ome_group = ome_zarr_image.to_zarr(ome_store, path='')
print(ome_group)
```

Now the Zarr group exists, we can get the array from it

```{code-cell} ipython3
level0_array = ome_group[ome_zarr_image.attributes.multiscales[0].datasets[0].path]
```

but as before, we haven't filled the array with any data yet.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("Before filling:")
print(level0_array[:, :, 0])
# Fill the data
level0_array[:] = zarr_array[:]
print("After filling:")
print(level0_array[:, :, 0])
```

The real power of OME-Zarr comes from not just storing original high resolution data, but including lower resolution copies alongside. This enables...

Lets remind ourselves of the current datasets in our Image

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(ome_zarr_image.attributes.multiscales[0].datasets[0])
```

To create downsampled datasets, we'll start with the original array specification, and create identical array specifications with smaller shapes.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import math

full_res_spec = ArraySpec.from_array(zarr_array)
print("Original array specification: ", full_res_spec)

downsample_levels = [0, 1, 2]
downsampled_specs = [
    full_res_spec.model_copy(
        update={"shape": tuple(math.ceil(i / 2**d) for i in full_res_spec.shape)
    }) for d in downsample_levels
]
print("Downsampled array specifications: ", downsampled_specs)
```

With this new set of array specifications we can create a OME-Zarr image with multiple downsampled levels

```{code-cell} ipython3
ome_zarr_image = Image.new(
    array_specs = downsampled_specs,
    paths = [f"level{d}" for d in downsample_levels],
    axes = [
        Axis(name="x", type="space", unit="um"),
        Axis(name="y", type="space", unit="um"),
        Axis(name="z", type="space", unit="um")
    ],
    global_scale = [voxel_size, voxel_size, voxel_size],
    scales = [[2**d, 2**d, 2**d] for d in downsample_levels],
    translations = [[0, 0, 0] for d in downsample_levels],
    name = "heart_image"
)
print(ome_zarr_image)
```
